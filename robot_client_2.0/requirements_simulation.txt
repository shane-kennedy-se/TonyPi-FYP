# Minimal Requirements for Simulation Mode
# Use this on Raspberry Pi 4 or any system without TonyPi hardware
# The client will automatically detect no hardware and run in simulation mode

# Core MQTT communication (required)
paho-mqtt>=2.0.0

# System metrics (required for CPU, memory, disk, temperature)
psutil>=5.9.0

# Note: Hardware-specific libraries (pyserial, smbus2) are NOT needed
# The client will gracefully handle missing hardware and use simulated data
